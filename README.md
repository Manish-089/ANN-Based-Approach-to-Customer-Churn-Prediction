ANN Project Showcase
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook exploring the implementation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for various machine learning tasks. The project covers:

1. Binary Classification
Objective: To build an ANN model to classify data into one of two categories.
Dataset: Churn Modelling dataset (details on features and target variable are in the notebook).
Approach: Includes data preprocessing (handling categorical features, scaling), building a Sequential model with Dense layers, compiling the model with appropriate loss and optimizer, training, and evaluating the model's accuracy.
2. Multiclass Classification
Objective: To develop an ANN model to classify images of handwritten digits into their corresponding classes (0-9).
Dataset: MNIST dataset (details on the dataset structure and pixel values are in the notebook).
Approach: Involves data normalization, flattening the image data, building a Sequential model with Dense layers and a softmax output layer, compiling with sparse categorical crossentropy, training, and evaluating the model's accuracy.
3. Regression
Objective: To create an ANN model to predict a continuous target variable.
Dataset: Admission Predict dataset (details on features and the target variable 'Chance of Admit' are in the notebook).
Approach: Includes data preprocessing (scaling), building a Sequential model with Dense layers and a linear output layer, compiling with mean squared error loss, training, and evaluating the model's performance using R-squared.
